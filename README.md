## Tech Stack

- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- HTML5 Canvas
- Vitest (testing)

## Testing

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run tests with coverage:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Current coverage: **97.2%** (excluding Canvas drawing logic and DOM APIs)

## Type Checking

Check TypeScript types without building:
```bash
npm run type-check
```

Watch mode for type checking:
```bash
npm run type-check:watch
```

The build process (`npm run build`) automatically runs type checking before building to catch errors early.

## Credits

This project is inspired by my sons, Pedro and Paulo ❤️ They love to paint comics and that's why I started to develop this project.

This project is almost 100% developed by Cursor (AI pair programming assistant).

## Known Issues

- **Text Duplication After Editing**: After editing text and pressing Enter, the text may appear duplicated. The original text becomes part of the background and is not selectable. This is a known issue that needs to be addressed.
- **Object Duplication After Loading**: After loading a saved file, moving objects may cause duplication. The original appears as part of the background and is not selectable. This is a known issue that needs to be addressed.

## Future Enhancements

- Layer support
- Cloud save
- Comic templates
