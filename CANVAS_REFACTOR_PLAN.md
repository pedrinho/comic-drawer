# Canvas.tsx refactor plan

**Status:** Phases 1 & 2 complete (2026-07-15, branch `refactor/canvas-phase-1-2-extractions`);
Phase 3 complete (2026-07-15, branch `refactor/canvas-phase-3-tool-controllers`); Phase 4 complete
(2026-07-15, branch `refactor/canvas-phase-4-object-ops`); Phase 5 complete (2026-07-15, branch
`refactor/canvas-phase-5-hooks`); Phase 6 complete (2026-07-15, branch
`refactor/canvas-phase-6-testing`). **All phases done.** Originally deferred from the
non-functional review (2026-07-14).

## Why

`src/components/Canvas.tsx` is a ~1033-line god-component. A single `useEffect`
(`Canvas.tsx:311-1012`, 13-item dependency array) owns mode resolution, overlay sizing, brush
setup, the full scene rebuild, `syncToLayers`, ~10 object-management closures, the raster
operations, every pointer handler, and a subtle teardown. There is no tool abstraction — behavior
is a nested-ternary mode dispatch plus imperative branches — so adding or changing a tool means
surgery across this one effect. It is also the single biggest coverage gap (~44%), because its
Fabric pointer pipeline can't be driven in jsdom.

The goal: decompose it into pure helpers + per-tool controllers + small hooks, each independently
testable, **without changing runtime behavior**.

## Must-preserve invariants (the landmines)

These are load-bearing and subtle. Any refactor MUST keep them intact; write characterization
notes/tests around them before moving code.

1. **Refs updated during render** (`Canvas.tsx:98-101`): `shapeLayersRef`/`textLayersRef` mirror
   props and are set *during render* so the effect (and its cleanup) read the current model,
   including a value the cleanup itself writes when committing an abandoned text edit.
2. **`shapeLayers`/`textLayers` are deliberately NOT in the effect deps** (`Canvas.tsx:1012`,
   381-384): live edits must not trigger a rebuild that clobbers the active selection. External
   model changes (undo/redo/load/panel-switch) re-run the effect via `panelData`/`layout`.
3. **Teardown does NOT blanket-sync canvas→model** (`Canvas.tsx:996-1005`): on a model-driven
   re-run the canvas is stale; syncing would clobber the just-restored model. The teardown commits
   *only* an in-place text edit the user abandoned by switching tools.
4. **One sync = one history entry** (`Canvas.tsx:436-441`): `syncToLayers` calls the shape update
   with the history flag and the text update with `skipHistory=true`, so a single action pushes one
   entry (not two near-identical ones that make undo appear to no-op).
5. **Chrome tagging** (`isChromeObject`): the raster substrate + grid rects are excluded from the
   canvas→model sync. Keep them excluded everywhere the object list is read.
6. **`disposed` guard** (`Canvas.tsx:335`, 393/404/473/487): async image/group loads must bail if
   the effect was torn down, or they add objects to a disposed canvas.

## Phases (incremental, each independently shippable)

### Phase 1 — Extract pure helpers (no behavior change, high test value) — ✅ DONE
Landed as `utils/floodFill.ts` (`floodFillImageData`, pure over `ImageData`), `utils/toolMode.ts`
(`toolToMode` + a `Mode` type in `types/common.ts`), `utils/id.ts` (`generateLayerId`), and
`utils/fabricScene.ts` (`canvasObjectsToLayers` + `buildScene`, with `isDisposed`/`applyObjectControls`
passed in as callbacks). Each has a co-located unit test.

Move logic that doesn't need React/effect scope out to `src/utils/`, and unit-test it:
- `floodFill` (`Canvas.tsx:190-275`) → `utils/floodFill.ts`. Pure pixel algorithm; test with real
  `ImageData` arrays (matches boundaries, respects tolerance, handles transparent target).
- `toolToMode(tool)` — replace the nested ternary (`Canvas.tsx:315-332`) with a pure map; unit-test
  every `Tool` → mode.
- `generateLayerId` (`Canvas.tsx:298-303`) → `utils/id.ts`.
- **`canvasObjectsToLayers(objects, scale)`** — extract the reader half of `syncToLayers`
  (`Canvas.tsx:421-435`) into a pure function returning `{ shapeLayers, textLayers }`. Highly
  testable with real Fabric objects, exactly like the existing `fabric*.test.ts` suite. This is the
  highest-value extraction — it pins the canvas→model contract.
- **`buildScene(canvas, { shapeLayers, textLayers, panelData, layout, scale })`** — extract the
  scene builder (`Canvas.tsx:376-414`), returning the raster handles it creates.

### Phase 2 — Type the Fabric custom-prop boundary — ✅ DONE
Killed the seam casts (Canvas.tsx 9→0, utils 41→1) via module augmentation in
`types/fabric-augment.d.ts` (types both reads and constructor-embedded keys — no `WeakMap`/accessor
churn needed) plus `utils/fabricMeta.ts` (`isActiveSelection`/`isEditingText`/`getScenePoint`) for
the Fabric-API gaps; also fixed `groupId` to use the `GROUP_ID_KEY` constant. The two surviving
casts (`obj.path as any[]`, `document.fonts`) are unrelated Fabric/DOM-shape gaps, left as-is.

### Phase 3 — Tool-strategy abstraction (the core change) — ✅ DONE
Landed as `utils/toolControllers.ts`: a `ToolController` interface (`{ onDown?, onMove?, onUp? }`),
a `ToolContext` for the shared services + tool params, per-tool factories holding their own gesture
state in closures (`dragCreateController` shared by shape+balloon, `textController`, `fillController`
owning `floodRaster`, `eraserController` owning `eraseSegment`, `scissorController` owning the cut
path), and `createToolController(mode, ctx)` — `select`/`pen`/`null` resolve to `null` (Fabric
handles picking; pen uses the native brush). `normalizeRect`/`BASE` moved here too. The effect now
builds the controller once and wires thin `mouse:down/move/up` wrappers to it; `hideSizeLabel()`
stays an effect-level `mouse:up` prefix (it also backs the select-mode scaling pill). Object-
management + `applyObjectControls` stay in the effect (Phase 4 moves them). Canvas.tsx shrank ~256
net lines. Co-located `toolControllers.test.ts` covers factory dispatch + shape/fill/text behaviors;
a Playwright/Chromium pass drove real gestures for every tool (create/move/text-edit/balloon/pen/
fill/eraser/emoji/scissor-cut→auto-select/undo) with objects preserved across all tool switches and
zero Canvas/Fabric errors.

### Phase 4 — Extract object-management (controls) concern — ✅ DONE
Landed as `utils/objectOps.ts` (`createObjectOps(canvas, deps)` returning duplicate/delete/merge/
ungroup, with `syncToLayers`/`scale`/`isDisposed`/`applyControls` as deps) and `utils/fabricControls.ts`
(`createObjectControls(ops, { mode, isCreationMode })` returning `applyObjectControls` + the
`mergeControl` instance; `iconControl` is module-private, and the mode-gated interactivity rules live
here). The two are mutually recursive (an op applies controls to the object it creates; a control
invokes an op), so the effect late-binds `applyObjectControls` via the same wrapper `buildScene`
already used. Co-located `objectOps.test.ts` (7) + `fabricControls.test.ts` (7) cover the ops, the
mode gating, and control→op wiring; a Playwright/Chromium pass drove all four on-selection buttons
(duplicate/delete/merge/ungroup) end-to-end with zero page errors. Canvas.tsx shrank ~170 net lines.

### Phase 5 — Decompose the component into hooks — ✅ DONE
Landed as `hooks/useFabricCanvas.ts` (init/dispose, returns the element + instance refs),
`hooks/useOverlaySizing.ts` (the persistent CSS-size sync effect), and `hooks/useCanvasController.ts`
(the render-synced model refs + `update*Layers` callbacks + the whole scene/sync/tool/events effect).
The plan's `useSceneSync` + `useActiveTool` were **kept as one hook**: that scene+tool logic is a
single atomic `useEffect` with one teardown (the events need the scene's raster handles + control
instances, and the teardown must off events before clearing the scene), so splitting it into two
effects would create cross-effect ordering/data hazards — a behavior-change risk this phase must
avoid. `fitCanvasToContainer` was extracted to `utils/overlayFit.ts` (pure, unit-tested) and shared
by the sizing hook and the controller. `Canvas.tsx` shrank 472→94 lines (a thin orchestrator: three
hook calls + JSX). Hook-call order preserves the original effect run/cleanup order exactly. Verified
by the existing component tests + a Playwright/Chromium lifecycle pass (draw, tool-switch non-clobber,
teardown-commit of an abandoned text edit, undo/redo, responsive resize) with zero page errors.

### Phase 6 — Testing & verification — ✅ DONE
- Unit tests for every extraction landed with their phase (`floodFill`/`toolToMode`/
  `canvasObjectsToLayers`/`buildScene` in Phase 1; `toolControllers` in Phase 3; `objectOps`/
  `fabricControls` in Phase 4; `overlayFit` in Phase 5). Phase 6 filled the remaining jsdom-drivable
  gaps: the eraser/scissor raster controllers and the async group-duplicate + `isDisposed` guard in
  `objectOps` (222 unit/component tests total).
- **Committed Playwright/Chromium e2e suite** (`e2e/canvas.spec.ts`, `playwright.config.ts`,
  `npm run e2e`, docs in `docs/e2e.md`): drives the gestures jsdom can't — draw + undo/redo (asserted
  via the canvas's own `toDataURL` pixels), teardown-commit of an abandoned text edit, every tool
  activating cleanly, and the duplicate control — all gated on zero runtime errors. `@playwright/test`
  added as a devDependency (reversing the earlier "keep it out" choice, per the Phase-6 decision);
  artifacts gitignored; `e2e/**` excluded from vitest.
- `vitest.config.ts` thresholds raised 70/65/60/70 → 82/70/70/82 to lock in the gains (real numbers
  ~84/72/74). Nothing was re-excluded — `Canvas.tsx` went ~44% → **100%**.

## Sequencing rationale
Pure extractions first (safe, immediately add coverage to the untested core), then type the
boundary, then the structural tool-strategy split (the risky part — now guarded by the tests added
in Phases 1-2), then the hook decomposition, then browser verification. Each phase leaves `main`
green and shippable.
