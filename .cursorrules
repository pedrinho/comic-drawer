# Commit Procedure

When the user asks to "commit proceedure" or "commit procedure", execute the following steps in order:

1. **Run unit tests** - Execute `npm test` to ensure all tests are passing
2. **Check test coverage** - Verify that new functionality has proper unit tests. If new features were added without tests, inform the user and ask if they want to add tests before committing
3. **Type check** - Run `npm run type-check` to ensure there are no TypeScript errors that would break the Vercel build
4. **Update README** - Review changes and update README.md if:
   - New features were added
   - Known issues were fixed
   - Dependencies changed
   - Usage instructions need updates
5. **Commit and sync** - After all checks pass:
   - Stage all changes: `git add -A`
   - Create a descriptive commit message based on the changes
   - Commit: `git commit -m "message"`
   - Push: `git push`

If any step fails, stop and inform the user about the issue before proceeding.
